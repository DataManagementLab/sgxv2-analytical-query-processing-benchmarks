# Intel SGXv2 Analytical Query Processing Benchmarks

This repository contains the code used in the EDBT 2025 paper "Benchmarking Analytical Query Processing in Intel SGXv2".

The code is structured into two directories. [Join-Benchmarks](Join-Benchmarks/README.md) contains our join benchmarks. The column scan benchmark and all other micro-benchmarks can be found in [Scan-Micro-Benchmarks](Scan-Micro-Benchmarks/README.md). Both directories contain a more in-depth readme on how to compile and run the code.

## Run Experiments

Please refer to the details in the sub-directories [Join-Benchmarks](Join-Benchmarks/README.md) and [Scan-Micro-Benchmarks](Scan-Micro-Benchmarks/README.md)
